# Hints to work with the repo without a problem:
#
# Everyone has his/her own branch, We all work inside our own branches.
#
## 1. Clone the repo first ---> git clone "your branch url"
## 2. Do your changes.
## 3. To push your changes to the repo follow the steps:
          #  git add .
          #  git commit -m "name your commit"
          #. git push origin "branch name"

#
# to run the react app run "npm start" in the app directory
